# `text.tranform` contains the functions that deal behind the scenes with the two main tasks when preparing texts for modelling: *tokenization* and *numericalization*.
#
# *Tokenization* splits the raw texts into tokens (which can be words, or punctuation signs...). The most basic way to do this would be to separate according to spaces, but it's possible to be more subtle; for instance, the contractions like "isn't" or "don't" should be split in \["is","n't"\] or \["do","n't"\]. By default fastai will use the powerful [spacy tokenizer](https://spacy.io/api/tokenizer).
#
# *Numericalization* is easier as it just consists in attributing a unique id to each token and mapping each of those tokens to their respective ids.

# ## Tokenization

# ### Introduction

# This step is actually divided in two phases: first, we apply a certain list of `rules` to the raw texts as preprocessing, then we use the tokenizer to split them in lists of tokens. Combining together those `rules`, the `tok_func`and the `lang` to process the texts is the role of the [`Tokenizer`](/text.transform.html#Tokenizer) class.

show_doc(Tokenizer)


# This class will process texts by applying them the `pre_rules`, tokenizing them with `tok_func(lang)` and then applying the `post_rules`. `special_cases` are a list of tokens passed as special to the tokenizer and `n_cpus` is the number of cpus to use for multi-processing (by default, half the cpus available). We don't directly pass a tokenizer for multi-processing purposes: each process needs to initiate a tokenizer of its own. The rules and special_cases default to:
#
# `defaults.text_pre_rules = [fix_html, replace_rep, replace_wrep, spec_add_spaces, rm_useless_spaces]` <div style="text-align: right"><a href="https://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/master/fastai/text/transform.py#L80">[source]</a></div>
#
# `defaults.text_post_rules = [replace_all_caps, deal_caps]` <div style="text-align: right"><a href="https://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/master/fastai/text/transform.py#L81">[source]</a></div>
#
# and
#
# `defaults.text_spec_tok = [UNK,PAD,BOS,FLD,TK_MAJ,TK_UP,TK_REP,TK_WREP]` <div style="text-align: right"><a href="https://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/master/fastai/text/transform.py#L10">[source]</a></div>
#
# The rules are all listed below, here is the meaning of the special tokens:
# - `UNK` (xxunk) is for an unknown word (one that isn't present in the current vocabulary)
# - `PAD` (xxpad) is the token used for padding, if we need to regroup several texts of different lengths in a batch
# - `BOS` (xxbos) represents the beginning of a text in your dataset
# - `FLD` (xxfld) is used if you set `mark_fields=True` in your [`TokenizeProcessor`](/text.data.html#TokenizeProcessor) to separate the different fields of texts (if your texts are loaded from several columns in a dataframe)
# - `TK_MAJ` (xxmaj) is used to indicate the next word begins with a capital in the original text
# - `TK_UP` (xxup) is used to indicate the next word is written in all caps in the original text
# - `TK_REP` (xxrep) is used to indicate the next character is repeated n times in the original text (usage xxrep n {char})
# - `TK_WREP`(xxwrep) is used to indicate the next word is repeated n times in the original text (usage xxwrep n {word})

show_doc(Tokenizer.process_text)


show_doc(Tokenizer.process_all)


# For an example, we're going to grab some IMDB reviews.

path = untar_data(URLs.IMDB_SAMPLE)
path


df = pd.read_csv(path / 'texts.csv', header=None)
example_text = df.iloc[2][1]; example_text


tokenizer = Tokenizer()
tok = SpacyTokenizer('en')
' '.join(tokenizer.process_text(example_text, tok))


# As explained before, the tokenizer split the text according to words/punctuations signs but in a smart manner. The rules (see below) also have modified the text a little bit. We can tokenize a list of texts directly at the same time:

df = pd.read_csv(path / 'texts.csv', header=None)
texts = df[1].values
tokenizer = Tokenizer()
tokens = tokenizer.process_all(texts)
' '.join(tokens[2])


# ### Customize the tokenizer

# The `tok_func` must return an instance of [`BaseTokenizer`](/text.transform.html#BaseTokenizer):

show_doc(BaseTokenizer)


show_doc(BaseTokenizer.tokenizer)


# Take a text `t` and returns the list of its tokens.

show_doc(BaseTokenizer.add_special_cases)


# Record a list of special tokens `toks`.

# The fastai library uses [spacy](https://spacy.io/) tokenizers as its default. The following class wraps it as [`BaseTokenizer`](/text.transform.html#BaseTokenizer).

show_doc(SpacyTokenizer)


# If you want to use your custom tokenizer, just subclass the [`BaseTokenizer`](/text.transform.html#BaseTokenizer) and override its `tokenizer` and `add_spec_cases` functions.

# ### Rules

# Rules are just functions that take a string and return the modified string. This allows you to customize the list of `default_pre_rules` or `default_post_rules` as you please. Those are:

show_doc(deal_caps, doc_string=False)


# In `t`, every word is lower-case. If a word begins with a capital, we put a token `TK_MAJ` in front of it.

show_doc(fix_html, doc_string=False)


# This rules replaces a bunch of HTML characters or norms in plain text ones. For instance `<br />` are replaced by `\n`, `&nbsp;` by spaces etc...

fix_html("Some HTML&nbsp;text<br />")


show_doc(replace_all_caps)


show_doc(replace_rep, doc_string=False)


# Whenever a character is repeated more than three times in `t`, we replace the whole thing by 'TK_REP n char' where n is the number of occurrences and char the character.

replace_rep("I'm so excited!!!!!!!!")


show_doc(replace_wrep, doc_string=False)


# Whenever a word is repeated more than four times in `t`, we replace the whole thing by 'TK_WREP n w' where n is the number of occurrences and w the word repeated.

replace_wrep("I've never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever done this.")


show_doc(rm_useless_spaces)


rm_useless_spaces("Inconsistent   use  of     spaces.")


show_doc(spec_add_spaces)


spec_add_spaces('I #like to #put #hashtags #everywhere!')


# ## Numericalization

# To convert our set of tokens to unique ids (and be able to have them go through embeddings), we use the following class:

show_doc(Vocab)


# `itos` contains the id to token correspondence.

show_doc(Vocab.create)


# Only keeps `max_vocab` tokens, and only if they appear at least `min_freq` times, set the rest to `UNK`.

show_doc(Vocab.numericalize)


show_doc(Vocab.textify)


vocab = Vocab.create(tokens, max_vocab=1000, min_freq=2)
vocab.numericalize(tokens[2])[:10]
