# ## Dynamic U-Net

# This module builds a dynamic [U-Net](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597) from any backbone pretrained on ImageNet, automatically inferring the intermediate sizes.

# ![U-Net architecture](imgs/u-net-architecture.png)
#
# This is the original U-Net. The difference here is that the left part is a pretrained model.

show_doc(DynamicUnet)


# This U-Net will sit on top of an `encoder` (that can be a pretrained model) and with a final output of `n_classes`. During the initialization, it uses [`Hooks`](/callbacks.hooks.html#Hooks) to determine the intermediate features sizes by passing a dummy input through the model and create the upward path automatically.
#
# `blur` is used to avoid checkerboard artifacts at each layer, `blur_final` is specific to the last layer. `self_attention` determines if we use a self attention layer at the third block before the end. If `y_range` is passed, the last activations go through a sigmoid rescaled to that range. `last_cross` determines if we use a cross-connection with the direct input of the model, and in this case `bottle` flags if we use a bottleneck or not for that skip connection.

show_doc(UnetBlock)


# This block receives the output of the last block to be upsampled (size `up_in_c`) and the activations features from an intermediate layer of the `encoder` (size `x_in_c`, this is the lateral connection). The `hook` is set to this intermediate layer to store the output needed for this block. `final_div` determines if we divide the number of features by 2 with the upsampling, `blur` is to avoid checkerboard artifacts. If `leaky` is set, use a leaky ReLU with a slope equals to that parameter instead of a ReLU, and `self_attention` determines if we use a self-attention layer. `kwargs` are passed to [`conv_layer`](/layers.html#conv_layer).
